        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The VFX Reference Platform is a set of tool and library versions to be used as a common target platform for building software for the VFX industry. Its purpose is to minimise incompatibilities between different software packages, ease the support burden for Linux-based pipelines and encourage further adoption of Linux by software vendors. The Reference Platform is updated annually by a group of software vendors in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ves-committees?jump-9">Visual Effects Society Technology Committee</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>

		<p>The Calendar Year 2021 (CY2021) Reference Platform is the target for all major software releases in 2021.</p>

		<p><strong>31st October 2021</strong> - OpenVDB 9.x confirmed for CY2022 following the release of 9.0.0 supporting OpenEXR 3.</p>

		<p><strong>1st September 2021</strong> - CY2022 is now Final. The only anticipated change is the pending OpenVDB release which is due by November 1st. If any major issues are discovered then they will be shared with the community to decide whether a late change is required. In addition, a new Support Guidance section has been added towards the bottom of this page.</p>

		<p><strong>23rd August 2021</strong> -  A recording of the Birds of a Feather event <a href="https://youtu.be/i4tXrtJBqK0">is now available</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>16th August 2021</strong> -  Thank you to all those who attended the Birds of a Feather event last week, the <a href="https://bit.ly/3iFPkpJ">slide deck is now available</a>. This is a last call for feedback on CY2022 before it is locked for Final on September 1st.</p>

		<p><strong>1st August 2021</strong> -  Everyone is invited to attend the annual <a href="https://s2021.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=bof_138&sess=sess434">VFX Reference Platform Birds of a Feather session at SIGGRAPH</a> on Wednesday August 11th at 12:30pm PT / 3:30pm ET / 8:30pm UK. This is an online session again this year, and <a href="https://s2021.siggraph.org/register/#reg-level-comparison">Basic Attendee</a> registration for the conference is required at a cost of $50, although <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Use+code+to+get+a+free+basic+pass+to+SIGGRAPH+2021">some vendors are offering a promo code</a> that provides free registration.</p>

        <h3 id="reference-platform">Reference Platform</h3>

        <p>Each annual reference platform is designated by the calendar year in which major product releases should be targeting that particular reference.</p>

		<p>All versions should be considered exact required versions, except for those components where <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-sort" aria-hidden="true"></span> indicates that:</p>
        <ul>
			<li>for systems (or software) providing the library at runtime, versions should be considered <em>minimum version required.</em></li>
			<li>otherwise, for software building software against the library, versions should be considered <em>highest version allowed</em></li>
        </ul>

				<p><u>Minimum Deployment Target in Xcode</u></p>
				<p>Xcode’s “Deployment Target” identifies the earliest OS version on which your software can run.</p>
				<p>To set the Deployment Target for the compiler, use the option "-mmacosx-version-min=10.13“ to specify the APIs marked as available. For the linker, use the option "-macosx_version_min 10.13" to instruct the linker to create a key in the Info.plist file which marks the executable as being able to run or not for a given OS version.</p>
				<p>The MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable also sets the minimum deployment target and is used if the compiler option is not specified.  The environment variable is also <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.html">recognized by CMake</a>.</p>
				<p>Note: Despite the backward compatibility, it is still possible for runtime behavior to be affected by SDK and OS version, hardware etc.</p>
				<p>More information on configuring developer tools is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/Configuring/configuring.html">available in the SDK documentation.</a></p>
				<p><u>Frameworks vs Shared Libraries</u></p>
				<p>In general, the Frameworks approach is recommended over shared libraries for building and deploying components like Qt and Python on macOS.</p>
				<p><u>UPDATE: May 22nd 2021 - CY2022 dropping 32-bit support</u></p>
				<p>The move to 10.15 requires all apps to be 64-bit, with 32-bit releases no longer supported.</p>
				<p><u>UPDATE: April 4th 2021 - Building Qt for macOS</u></p>
				<p>Building Qt against C++17 requires a minimum macOS version of 10.14 otherwise Qt fails during configuration. If 10.13 support is needed then a known workaround is to build Qt against C++14.</p>

				<p>For users of RHEL-derived Linux distributions, the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/developertoolset/overview">Redhat Developer Toolset (DTS)</a> offers gcc and other build tooling that provide increased compatibility and it is used by many software vendors and studios. <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_toolset/9/html/9.1_release_notes/index">DTS 9.1</a> provides gcc 9.3.1 for compatibility with CY2021.</p>
				<p>For those who want or need to use llvm, some studios have been successful building <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> with DTS and using that to build software that is compatible with vendor-provided libraries.</p>
				<p>Since gcc 5.1, libstdc++ <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html"> introduced a new library ABI</a> that includes new implementations of std::string and std::list. In order to maintain backwards compatibility the old implementations are still supported in parallel with the new ones. The choice of implementation is made using the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro, and the VFX Reference Platform is still using the older option so the compiler setting should be _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0, although that setting <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1546704">may not be supported</a> by some distros yet.

				<p>The vanilla gcc 4.8.2 has a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58800">serious bug</a> that was fixed in 4.8.3 and some Linux distribution vendors actually ship a patched version as 4.8.2.

			<div class="panel-body">
				<small>
				<p>The major change for CY2016 was a move to Qt 5 which required a port of PySide and modifications to vanilla Qt. In November 2015 CY2016 version of Qt was upped from 5.5.x to 5.6.x with agreement from the community that it was preferable to align with a Long Term Support release. In May 2016 it was updated again to 5.6.1 to incorporate some critical bug fixes.</p>

				<p>These modifications are required to avoid the introduction of functional UI regressions impacting DCC tools and consist only of backported bug fixes and critical changes that have not yet been accepted into the mainline Qt distribution. The need for these modifications is not new, currently some software vendors ship their own differently modified Qt so CY2016 represented a significant step forward with the goal of all software vendors sharing an identically modified Qt. We are working with the Qt Company to eliminate the need for these modifications entirely in a future release, potentially as soon as CY2019.</p>

				<p>These Qt 5.6 modifications are available on Github from these forks of <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtbase/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtbase</a>, <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtx11extras/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtx11extras</a> and <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-forks/qtdeclarative/tree/adsk-contrib/vfx/5.6.1">qtdeclarative</a>. These modifications to <a href="http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.6/5.6.1/">Qt 5.6.1</a> should be used by anyone who wishes to build Qt applications against the Platforms from CY2016 through to CY2018. </p>

        <h3 id="support-guidance">Support Guidance</h3>

		<p>Providers of software libraries focused on VFX and animation content creation should aim to support their releases for the current calendar year and the three preceding years with compatible updates. Studios and end users should have no expectation of support for older libraries. </p>
		<p>The VFX Reference Platform strongly recommends open source project maintainers provide a level of support described by the <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria">FLOSS Best Practices Criteria</a>, which is already a requirement for all Academy Software Foundation projects.</p>

		<p><strong>31st July 2021</strong> -  Updates to CY2022 Draft for MKL, OpenEXR, and OpenVDB.</p>

		<p><strong>22nd March 2021</strong> - CY2021 has been updated to revert OpenEXR from 3.0.x back to 2.4.x due to a late release of OpenEXR 3 meaning that software vendors continued to ship products using 2.4. A change in policy to only allow released versions to be included in each year's VFX Reference Platform should prevent this from happening again in future. Also, FBX has been reverted to 2020.x due to there being no 2021.x released in time for CY2021.</p>
